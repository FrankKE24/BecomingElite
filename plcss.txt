Hallo, World!, today is Wednesday.s) are typically programmed using specialized languages designed for automation and industrial control systems. The most common languages used to program PLCs are defined by the IEC 61131-3 standard. These languages include:

1. **Ladder Logic (Ladder Diagram - LD):** 
   - A graphical programming language resembling electrical relay logic diagrams.
   - Widely used due to its intuitive, visual nature which makes it easier for electricians and engineers to understand and troubleshoot.

2. **Function Block Diagram (FBD):**
   - A graphical language that uses blocks to represent functions and their connections.
   - Commonly used for continuous control applications.

3. **Structured Text (ST):**
   - A high-level, text-based language similar to Pascal.
   - Suitable for complex algorithms and calculations.

4. **Instruction List (IL):**
   - A low-level, text-based language similar to assembly language.
   - Used for simple, linear control logic.

5. **Sequential Function Chart (SFC):**
   - A graphical language used to represent sequential control processes.
   - Ideal for processes that require a series of steps or stages.

These languages allow for flexibility in programming PLCs to suit different applications and industries.

There are several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) that are commonly used to write and develop PLC programs. Some of the popular IDEs include:

1. **Siemens TIA Portal**: 
   - Used primarily for Siemens PLCs.
   - Supports programming languages defined by the IEC 61131-3 standard, including Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram, and Structured Text.

2. **Rockwell Automation Studio 5000**:
   - Used for Allen-Bradley PLCs.
   - Supports Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram, Structured Text, and Sequential Function Chart.

3. **Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Control Expert (formerly Unity Pro)**:
   - Used for Schneider Electric PLCs.
   - Supports IEC 61131-3 programming languages.

4. **Omron CX-One/CX-Programmer**:
   - Used for Omron PLCs.
   - Supports Ladder Logic, Function Block Diagram, and Structured Text.

5. **Mitsubishi GX Works**:
   - Used for Mitsubishi PLCs.
   - Supports Ladder Logic, Structured Text, and Function Block Diagram.

6. **Codesys**:
   - A versatile and widely-used platform that supports a range of PLCs from different manufacturers.
   - Compliant with IEC 61131-3 standard and supports all five programming languages defined in the standard.

7. **Beckhoff TwinCAT**:
   - Used for Beckhoff PLCs.
   - Supports IEC 61131-3 programming languages.

8. **WAGO e!COCKPIT**:
   - Used for WAGO PLCs.
   - Supports IEC 61131-3 programming languages.

These IDEs provide a range of tools and features to facilitate the development, debugging, and deployment of PLC programs, making it easier for engineers and technicians to work on complex automation projects.
